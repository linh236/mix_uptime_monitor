# README
You'll notice on the uptime monitoring project the buttons are not updated on click.

When you click the "Monitor" button, the monitoring process starts, but the button still says "Monitor".

Your assignment is to fix this bug.

When you click the "Monitor" button, it should switch to "Stop Monitoring" without having to refresh the page, and the "Ping" button should disappear.

And when you stop the monitoring, the "Stop monitoring" button should go away, and the "Ping" and "Monitor" buttons should show up again.

Once you're done, please upload the project to GitHub and submit the link for review.

Good luck.
